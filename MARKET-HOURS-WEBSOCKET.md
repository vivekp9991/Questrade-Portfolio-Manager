# 🕐 Market Hours WebSocket - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Was Built

WebSocket now **automatically** runs ONLY during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday) using **web-based Eastern Time** (not system time).

---

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Web-Based EST Time** ✅
- Uses WorldTimeAPI.org to fetch current Eastern Time
- **Does NOT use system time** - always accurate regardless of user's timezone
- Falls back to alternate API if primary fails
- Caches time for 1 minute to reduce API calls

### 2. **Smart Market Hours Detection** ✅
- Checks if market is currently open (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Checks if weekend (markets closed)
- Checks for US market holidays (simplified - can be enhanced)
- Shows time remaining until market opens/closes

### 3. **Automatic Connection Management** ✅
- **During market hours**: WebSocket connects automatically
- **Outside market hours**: WebSocket does NOT connect (uses polling fallback)
- **Market opens**: WebSocket connects automatically (checks every 5 minutes)
- **Market closes**: WebSocket disconnects automatically (checks every 5 minutes)

### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring** ✅
- Checks market status every 5 minutes
- Auto-connects when market opens
- Auto-disconnects when market closes
- Shows helpful console messages with countdown timers

## 🧪 How to Test Right Now

### Test 1: Check Console Output (Markets Closed)

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Press F12** (console)
3. **Look for**:

```
[QT WebSocket] 🔴 Market CLOSED (opens in 15h 30m) - 6:00 PM ET
[QT WebSocket] 🔴 Market is CLOSED - WebSocket will not connect
[QT WebSocket] Reason: After-hours - Closed at 4:00 PM ET
[QT WebSocket] Next market open in: 15h 30m
[QT WebSocket] 📅 Market hours monitoring started (checks every 5 minutes)
```

**Result**: ✅ WebSocket does NOT connect (markets closed)

---

### Test 2: Check Console Output (During Market Hours)

**Next trading day at 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET**:

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Press F12** (console)
3. **Look for**:

```
[QT WebSocket] 🟢 Market OPEN (closes in 6h 30m) - 9:30 AM ET
[QT WebSocket] 🟢 Market is OPEN - Proceeding with WebSocket connection...
[QT WebSocket] Starting connection for 45 symbols...
[QT WebSocket] Access token retrieved
[QT WebSocket] Got 45 symbol IDs
[QT WebSocket] Connecting to: wss://api05.iq.questrade.com/v1/markets/quotes?ids=...&stream=true&mode=RawSocket
[QT WebSocket] Connection opened, authenticating...
[QT WebSocket] ✅ Authenticated successfully!
[QT WebSocket] 📅 Market hours monitoring started (checks every 5 minutes)
```

**Result**: ✅ WebSocket connects automatically!

---

### Test 3: Test Market Close (at 4:00 PM ET)

**During market hours**, wait until **4:00 PM ET**:

Console will show:
```
[QT WebSocket] 🔴 Market CLOSED - Disconnecting WebSocket...
[QT WebSocket] Reason: After-hours - Closed at 4:00 PM ET
[QT WebSocket] Disconnecting...
```

**Result**: ✅ WebSocket disconnects automatically at market close!

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Market Hours Check Frequency

**File**: `src/services/questradeWebSocket.js` (Line 421)

```javascript
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // Check every 5 minutes

// Change to 1 minute:
}, 1 * 60 * 1000); // Check every 1 minute

// Change to 10 minutes:
}, 10 * 60 * 1000); // Check every 10 minutes
```

### Change Time API Cache Duration

**File**: `src/services/marketHours.js` (Line 12)

```javascript
this.CACHE_DURATION = 60000; // Cache for 1 minute

// Change to 5 minutes:
this.CACHE_DURATION = 5 * 60000; // Cache for 5 minutes
```

### Change Time API Source

**File**: `src/services/marketHours.js` (Line 28)

```javascript
// Primary API
const response = await fetch('https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York');

// Alternate APIs:
// 1. WorldClockAPI
const response = await fetch('http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/est/now');

// 2. TimeAPI.io
const response = await fetch('https://timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=America/New_York');
```

```
1. App loads
2. Market hours checker: "Market is OPEN"
3. WebSocket connects
4. Real-time quotes start flowing
5. Every 5 minutes: Checks if market still open
6. At 4:00 PM ET: WebSocket disconnects automatically
```

### Scenario 2: Load App Outside Market Hours
```
1. App loads
2. Market hours checker: "Market is CLOSED"
3. WebSocket does NOT connect
4. Polling fallback activates (updates every 30 seconds)
5. Every 5 minutes: Checks if market opened

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Time Fetching (Web-Based)
```javascript
// Fetches from https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York
// Returns: { datetime: "2025-10-09T15:30:00.000-04:00", ... }
// Converts to Eastern Time Date object
// Caches for 1 minute to reduce API calls
```

### 2. Market Hours Check
```javascript
// Get current Eastern Time from web
const easternTime = await getCurrentEasternTime();

// Get day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
const dayOfWeek = easternTime.getDay();

// Get time in minutes (9:30 AM = 570 minutes, 4:00 PM = 960 minutes)
const timeInMinutes = hours * 60 + minutes;

// Check if weekday + within 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM
const isOpen = (dayOfWeek >= 1 && dayOfWeek <= 5) &&
               (timeInMinutes >= 570 && timeInMinutes < 960);
```

### 3. Auto Connect/Disconnect
```javascript
// Every 5 minutes:
setInterval(async () => {
  const marketStatus = await marketHoursService.isMarketOpen();

  if (marketStatus.isOpen && !this.isConnected()) {
    // Market just opened → Connect
    await this._performConnection(symbols, onQuoteUpdate);
  } else if (!marketStatus.isOpen && this.isConnected()) {
    // Market just closed → Disconnect
    this.disconnect();
  }
}, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unable to determine market hours"

**Cause**: Time API is down or blocked

**Solution**: Check browser console for errors
```javascript
// If you see: "Failed to fetch Eastern Time from web"
// The service will try fallback APIs automatically
```

### Issue: WebSocket connects when market is closed

**Check 1**: Console shows market status
```
Look for: [QT WebSocket] 🟢 Market OPEN
```

**Check 2**: Verify Eastern Time is correct
```javascript
// Add this to console:
const marketHours = await import('./services/marketHours');
const time = await marketHours.default.getCurrentEasternTime();
console.log('Eastern Time:', time);
```

**Check 3**: Browser timezone
```javascript
// The service should NOT use browser time
// It should fetch from web API
```

### Issue: Time API is being blocked

**Solution**: Use alternate API

**File**: `src/services/marketHours.js` (Line 28)
```javascript
// Try this alternate API:
const response = await fetch('https://timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=America/New_York');
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

### API Calls

**Before** (without market hours check):
- WebSocket connection attempts: Continuous (even when closed)
- Failed connections: Multiple per minute

**After** (with market hours check):
- Time API calls: ~1 per minute (cached)
- Market hours checks: Every 5 minutes
- WebSocket connections: Only during market hours ✅

### Benefits

1. ✅ **Fewer failed connections** (no attempts when market closed)
2. ✅ **Lower network usage** (no WebSocket traffic after hours)
3. ✅ **Better battery life** (WebSocket disconnected when not needed)
4. ✅ **Accurate timezone** (uses web time, not system time)

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Test 1**: Load app outside market hours → WebSocket does NOT connect
- [ ] **Test 2**: Load app during market hours → WebSocket connects
- [ ] **Test 3**: Keep app open until market closes → WebSocket disconnects at 4 PM ET
- [ ] **Test 4**: Keep app open until market opens → WebSocket connects at 9:30 AM ET
- [ ] **Test 5**: Check console for accurate Eastern Time
- [ ] **Test 6**: Verify countdown timers are accurate

## 📝 What Happens Right Now

Since markets are **currently CLOSED**, when you load the app:

```
[QT WebSocket] 🔴 Market CLOSED (opens in 15h 30m) - 6:00 PM ET
[QT WebSocket] 🔴 Market is CLOSED - WebSocket will not connect
[QT WebSocket] Reason: After-hours - Closed at 4:00 PM ET
[QT WebSocket] Next market open in: 15h 30m
[QT WebSocket] 📅 Market hours monitoring started (checks every 5 minutes)
```

**Tomorrow at 9:30 AM ET**, the app will automatically detect market open and connect WebSocket! 🎉

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready to Test!**

**Next Step**: Refresh browser and check console for market hours status!
